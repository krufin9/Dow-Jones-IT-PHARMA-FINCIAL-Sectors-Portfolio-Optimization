# Dow-Jones-IT-PHARMA-FINCIAL-Sectors-Portfolio-Optimization
Aim for this project is to increase the annualized returns and reduce the risk of the portfolio. In this project, I have taken three sectors portfolios with $1M. Initially each asset has an equal weightage. After calculating their annualized returns, the first step was to calculate the annualized covariance matrix to find the covariances between the assets. Second step is to calculate the portfolio variance, the portfolio volatility(std dev), and annual portfolio returns. Now with efficient frontier and with optimizing for max sharpe ratio I've calculated the expected returns and annualized sample covariance matrix of asset returns. Finally I've assigned discrete allocation of each share per stock.
